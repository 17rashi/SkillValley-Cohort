# PROBLEM STATEMENT 💡
- It is often hard to find mentors if you have some doubt or want to get guidance in any specific technical subfield.🤔
- There are a lot of students who are highly skilled and want to join community, contribute in open source and can play great role in companies but they don't know where and how to start/join.🔍
- College students missed lot of oppurtunities like scholarships, internship programs, hackathons and mentorship program because they don't know about it.📰
- If anyone wants to learn a particular language or any subject but due to lots of online courses they ended up with wasting their time and also lack motivation in learning.⏲
